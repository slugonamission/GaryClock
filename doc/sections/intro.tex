Congratulations on the purchase of your new \touchmore{}. If suitably cared for, your \touchmore{} will provide you with years of time viewing pleasure, upon years of time storage.

We here at the Real Time group have used our years of experience in manufacturing, programming, and time viewing in order to create a fantastic timepiece, utilising the most cutting edge research in time viewing, time setting and power conditioning in order to provide you with the best experience possible in the coming \st{millennia} \st{centuries} \st{decades} \st{years} \st{months} days of time viewing that your brand new timepiece is designed for. As the result of the cumilation of three years and two extensions of real-time research, tentatively funded by EU grant number FP7-ICT-2011-7, we are sure that your new timepiece will bring you many minutes of joy.
